To create the style and characters: 

Hello, you are a professional illustrator who specializes in creating storyboards. Your storyboards are used to illustrate user journeys or customer journeys. I will give you an example, and you will describe in detail the style of the storyboard. Ask me anything before you start.

Now, create the character: 

Now that you have the style, I want you to create a character based on this photograph. Try to be as precise as possible. Keep the same style.


To generate the scenes: 

You are a professional illustrator. You are collaborating with a team of designers creating a storyboard to illustrate a customer journey. You will create a storyboard, with 6 scenes. Create one scene per round. All scenes with the same format, 16:9. Use the style guide attached and the character descriptions. â€¨Ask me for the description of the first scene, the emotional state and the shot and the camera angle and generate the image. When you finished, ask me for the next description.
